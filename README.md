# duck_duck_gate
Opencv application for friends garden. If x number of ducks come back to their pen for x period of time - close gate and send email.

Hoping to have either a text file or a basic dialog where the end user can decide what in the video stream they'd like to detect and what in the result of that detection they'd like to happen
would be useful for many general purposes.
